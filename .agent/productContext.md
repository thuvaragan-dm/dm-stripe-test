## Product Context

Why: Demonstrate a SaaS model that combines subscriptions with usage-based billing via tokens.

How it should work:
- Users choose a subscription plan and receive plan tokens each billing cycle.
- Users can top up tokens via one-time purchases. Top-up tokens roll over.
- Usage deducts from subscription tokens first, then from purchased tokens.
- Dashboard shows balances and allows simulating usage and top-ups.

UX goals:
- Clear pricing page with plans, prices, and tokens.
- Simple dashboard showing token balances and actions.
