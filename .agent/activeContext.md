## Active Context

Focus: Build POC with plans, checkout, usage, and webhooks. Hardcoded user.

Decisions:
- Use placeholder Stripe price IDs; user will replace.
- Use a hardcoded user ID for all API calls.

Next steps:
1. Add Prisma schema and client.
2. Implement plans config.
3. Build APIs: checkout, usage, webhook.
4. Build pages: pricing and dashboard.
